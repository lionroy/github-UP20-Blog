# Dear #UP20 Reader,
### _UP20 is an opensource community dedicated_
### _to expand and share social programs resources and best practice_


Welcome to UP20 repository build via GitHub Learning Lab course. 
This repository will be used during the different activities that we'll build together. 
You can take action and join us as an equal member - Here and Now. _opensource magic_
happens when prople contribute lines of code for everyone to use.
UP20 brings the opensource methodology to the social field - one stop shop for NGO's,
governments and educators around the world can collaborate and reach out for more.

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

I'm the GitHub Learning Lab bot and I'm here to help guide you in your journey to learn and master the various topics covered in this course. Just kidding,
My name is Roy Leon, and today I am working alongside SDG activists to facilitate these worthy goals.

I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with community members. In fact, my learning curve isn't steep at all, and the reason for that is to be able to share and communicate github's magnificent capabilities. That's Capacity Building in action for you to check out.

_I also love the fact github is reaching out to meet non-coders, who seem to be a silent majority in terms of opensource_

Without further ado, I fare thy well and hopefully soon, we shall meet (again)

I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!
